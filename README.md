# PythonCodes

This code helps in connecting SSMS using python.

I have used Spyder for doing the same.

There are few basic strings that needs to be input while running the code. This would change from person to person .

Steps to check the following inputs in ssms.

1) Open SSMS
2) You will be prompted for server name, username, password. The same needs to be input in the code.
3) Under the Connection properties, you will find the database string.

Once all the connections are done, try accessing one of the tables.
